/**
 * StateAction displays a list of possible state transitions and raises an AR model event.
 *
 * It requires to be used by a NetController class.
 *
 * Installation steps:
 * * optionally, call the fsm console command to generate migrations, run them and create two models
 * * implement the IStateful interface in the main model
 * * include a new 'transition' scenario in validation rules, most often it would make a 'notes' attribute
 *   safe or even required
 * * optionally, add an inline validator that would depend on the source state
 * * copy the views into the controller's viewPath
 * * call StateAction::getContextMenuItem when building the context menu in CRUD controller
